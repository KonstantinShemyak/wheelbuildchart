		<h1><a href="index.html">Wheelbuilding chart</a>: what is this</h1>

		<p>When building or truing a bicycle wheel, one should monitor two aspects:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The wheel must be true.</li>
			<li>The spokes must be tightened equally (on each side).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>It may be nontrivial to satisfy <strong>both</strong> conditions: when you
		tighten all spokes equally, the wheel is <strong>not</strong> true! So you need
		to balance between the two imperfections.<p>
		<p>Folklore calls this "art". With this tool, you likely find that the term "accuracy" is
		more relevant.</p>

		<h2>What does this tool do</h2>

		<p>When you input tension values, they are shown on a radar chart. This gives you
		an overal picture, how much tension inequality you have and what are the biggest
		"painpoints" (most overtightened or slack spokes). You'll know better whether
		you should tighten or weaken something on your next spoke wrench attempt.</p>

		<h2>What this tool does NOT do</h2>

		<p>There is no magic. This is only visualization of the data you already have.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>It does not measure tension. You need a <strong>tensometer</strong> for that.</li>
			<li>It does not show the deviations of the wheel. It only shows the spoke tension.</li>
			<li>It does not show tell you which spoke to tighten/release. You must check the
			wheel deformation (both radial and lateral) and make the decision.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Usage hints</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Number your spokes. For rim brake wheels, marker on the braking
				surface works good. For disk brake wheels, marker on white
				aluminium or corrector paste on black works kind of OK.</li>
			<li>Do one round: measure all spokes and input values.</li>
			<li>Rotate the wheel and record (or remember) the biggest "problem":
				radial distortion (inside/outside) or side deflection (drive/non-drive).
				Mark approximate spoke number where it happens.</li>
			<li>In case of radial distortion: deside, do you need to tighten/release the
				spokes at the "problematic region" or to tighten/release all
				other spokes. For example, if you have a buldge at about spoke 10,
				and spoke 10 is too slack, then spoke 10 should be tensioned.
				If spoke 10 is too tight, then all other spokes should be released.</li>
			<li>During each step, do only one half-turn. Repeat until tension deviations
				are under 10%.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The author was able to build in practice perfect wheels: maximal tension as
			allowed by the rim manufacturer, deviations under 5%, no visible deflections.</p>
