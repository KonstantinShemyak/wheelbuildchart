    <title>Wheelbuilding chart: my spoke is not supported?</title>

    <h1 class="text-center text-primary">
      <a href="index.html">Wheelbuilding chart</a>: what if my spoke is not
      supported?
    </h1>

    <p>
      If your <b>tensometer</b> is in the list, but your <b>spoke type</b> is
      not, you can interpolate readings for your tensometer using some other
      tensometer which supports your spokes.
    </p>

    <p>Here is my answer to a person asking this:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
> By any chance, would you have conversion data for the tensometer ZTTO
> TC-02 for DT Aero Comp 2.0/2.3x1.2 ?
</pre
      >

      <p>
        No. I got the data from the charts the vendors publish; so, ZTTO didn't
        include these spokes in their charts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The "closest" spoke which ZTTO knows about is probably 1.8-1.5-1.8mm
        round. In your situation, I'd use the charts published by DT Swiss (for
        their own tensometer) to compare, how much more does the round 1.5mm
        spoke deflect the tensometer than the bladed one, and then use ZTTO with
        the round spoke:
      </p>

      <p>
        1. Check the max tension allowed by the rim (it's almost always the rim
        which limits how much the spokes can be tensioned). Let's say, for
        example, 100kgf ~ 1000N.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Check in the DT chart, what value DT tensometer will show for DT Aero
        Comp spokes for 1000N (find the chart on DTSwiss site). In the version
        which I downloaded, these spokes are on page 28. We see that the DT
        tensometer reading would be 0.98mm.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. From the same DT chart, see how much smaller tensometer reading does
        1.8-1.5-1.8 spoke produce for the same tension (for me it was page 21).
        We see that for this spoke, 1000N results in reading 1.21mm. So, around
        1000N tension, (tensometer reading for DT Aero Comp) = 0.98 / 1.21 *
        (tensometer reading for 1.5mm round spoke).
      </p>

      <p>
        4. For 1.5mm spoke, tension of 100kgf will result in ZTTO tensometer
        reading 2.1. (This can be checked in the "wheelbui lding chart".) Using
        the above, we conclude that for DT Aero Comp the reading should be 2.1 *
        0.98 / 1.21 ~ 1.7.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, using DT Aero Comp spokes with ZTTO tensometer, don't exceed meter
        reading 1.7 (or the one calculated for your rim's max allowed tension).
        Otherwise just minimize the tension deviation with the wheelbuilding
        chart as usual.
      </p>

      <p>Hope this helps!</p>
