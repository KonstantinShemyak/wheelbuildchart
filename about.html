      <a href="index.html">Wheelbuilding chart</a>: what is this
    </h1>

    <p>
      When building or truing a bicycle wheel, one should monitor two aspects:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The wheel must be true.</li>
      <li>The spokes must be tightened equally (on each side).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It may be nontrivial to satisfy <strong>both</strong> conditions: when you
      tighten all spokes equally, the wheel is <strong>not</strong> true! So you
      need to balance between the two imperfections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folklore calls this "art". With this tool, you likely find that the term
      "accuracy" is more relevant.
    </p>

    <h2>What does this tool do</h2>

    <p>
      When you input tension values, they are shown on a radar chart. This gives
      you an overal picture, how much tension inequality you have and what are
      the biggest "painpoints" (most overtightened or slack spokes). You'll know
      better whether you should tighten or weaken something on your next spoke
      wrench attempt.
    </p>

    <h2>What this tool does NOT do</h2>

    <p>
      There is no magic. This is only visualization of the data you already
      have.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        It does not measure tension. You need a <strong>tensometer</strong> for
        that.
      </li>
      <li>
        It does not show the deviations of the wheel. It only shows the spoke
        tension.
      </li>
      <li>
        It does not tell you which spoke to tighten/release. You must check the
        wheel deformation (both radial and lateral) and make the decision.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage hints</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Number your spokes. For rim brake wheels, marker on the braking surface
        works good. For disk brake wheels, marker on white aluminium or white
        corrector paste on black works kind of OK. If nothing else works, marks
        on the rim tape are always possible.
      </li>
      <li>Do one round: measure all spokes and input tension values.</li>
      <li>
        Rotate the wheel and record (or remember) the biggest "problem": radial
        distortion (inside/outside) or side deflection (drive/non-drive). Record
        approximate spoke number where it happens.
      </li>
      <li>
        In case of radial distortion: deside, do you need to tighten/release the
        spokes at the "problematic region" or to tighten/release all other
        spokes. For example, if you have a buldge at about spoke 10, and spoke
        10 is too slack, then spoke 10 should be tensioned. If spoke 10 is too
        tight, then all other spokes should be released.
      </li>
      <li>
        Typically <strong>radial</strong> distortions are most easily corrected
        only when the wheel is not yet tightened much. When tight, even small
        changes to spoke lengths - which are not enough to affect radial
        bulge/pit - already result in significant left/right moving of the rim
        section.
      </li>
      <li>
        During each step, do only one half-turn by the spoke wrench. Repeat
        until tension deviations are under 10%.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The author was able to build in practice perfect wheels: maximum tension
      as allowed by the rim manufacturer, deviations under 5%, no visible rim
      deflections.
